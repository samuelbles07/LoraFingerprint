This is an Arduino library for the R30x/ZFMxx/FPMxx optical fingerprint sensors,
built off of the Adafruit Fingerprint Sensor Library: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Fingerprint-Sensor-Library. 

Included are a Python script and a Windows executable for extracting fingerprint images to a PC; 
the `image_to_pc` example must first be uploaded to the Arduino. 

For optimal reliability, baud rates <= 57600 are recommended regarding `SoftwareSerial` usage, 
especially when retrieving fingerprint images. 

Datasheet found at https://sicherheitskritisch.de/files/specifications-2.0-en.pdf

Note: The `led_on()`, `led_off()` and `getImageNL()` methods have only been tested successfully with ZFM60 modules.
